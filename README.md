✨ I’ve built a full stack web application from scratch, inspired by the functionalities of Airbnb!

**🔍 Key Technologies:**

1️⃣ **Frontend:** EJS, CSS for dynamic and responsive design.

2️⃣ **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js to handle server-side logic and routes.

3️⃣ **Database:** MongoDB for managing data storage with CRUD operations.

4️⃣ **User Management:** Authentication and Authorization to ensure secure access.

5️⃣ **User Experience:** Implemented middleware, cookies, and Express sessions to enhance functionality.

6️⃣ **Image Handling:** Integrated Cloudinary for seamless image uploads and management.

7️⃣ **Map Integration:** Added interactive maps using Mapbox for location-based features.

8️⃣ **MVC Architecture:** Organized code efficiently using the MVC pattern for scalability and maintainability.

I’ve learned so much from this experience, from managing the backend infrastructure to creating a smooth user interface. This project has allowed me to explore various web technologies and enhance my skills in building dynamic web applications.
