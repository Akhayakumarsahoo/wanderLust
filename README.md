I’ve built a full stack web application from scratch, inspired by the functionalities of Airbnb! 🏠✨

🔍 Key Technologies:
Frontend: EJS, CSS for dynamic and responsive design.
Backend: Node.js, Express.js to handle server-side logic and routes.
Database: MongoDB for managing data storage with CRUD operations.
User Management: Authentication and Authorization to ensure secure access.
User Experience: Implemented middleware, cookies, and Express sessions to enhance functionality.
Image Handling: Integrated Cloudinary for seamless image uploads and management.
Map Integration: Added interactive maps using Mapbox for location-based features.
MVC Architecture: Organized code efficiently using the MVC pattern for scalability and maintainability.

I’ve learned so much from this experience, from managing the backend infrastructure to creating a smooth user interface. This project has allowed me to explore various web technologies and enhance my skills in building dynamic web applications.
