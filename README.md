I’ve built a full stack web application from scratch, inspired by the functionalities of Airbnb! 🏠✨

🔍 Key Technologies:

1️⃣ Frontend: EJS, CSS for dynamic and responsive design.

2️⃣ Backend: Node.js, Express.js to handle server-side logic and routes.

3️⃣ Database: MongoDB for managing data storage with CRUD operations.

4️⃣ User Management: Authentication and Authorization to ensure secure access.

5️⃣ User Experience: Implemented middleware, cookies, and Express sessions to enhance functionality.

6️⃣ Image Handling: Integrated Cloudinary for seamless image uploads and management.

7️⃣ Map Integration: Added interactive maps using Mapbox for location-based features.

8️⃣ MVC Architecture: Organized code efficiently using the MVC pattern for scalability and maintainability.

I’ve learned so much from this experience, from managing the backend infrastructure to creating a smooth user interface. This project has allowed me to explore various web technologies and enhance my skills in building dynamic web applications.
